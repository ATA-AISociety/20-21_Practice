## Oh no! Someone has filled my list (which was supposed to collect the number of pets everyone had) with strinsg and decimal numbers. 
## Please fix this by removing all invalid inputs from the list
## Then order all remaining elements of the list least to greatest
## Finally, use a while loop to make sure that an input statement only accepts whole number integers
## Thank you coders
## - Person who didn't input validate
